What is FMPP?
-------------

FMPP is a general-purpose text file preprocessor tool that uses
FreeMarker templates. It is particularly designed for HTML preprocessor,
for the generation of complete (static) home-pages: directory structure
that contains HTML-s, image files, etc. But of course it can be used to
generate source code or whatever text files. FMPP is extendable with
Java classes to pull data from any data sources (as a database) and
embed the data into the generated files.

FMPP can be used with UN*X-style command-line interface, or as Ant task,
or you can embed it into your Java application.
