/**
 * Creates an object that will be accessed in FreeMarker templates. The typical
 * usage is with the "data" setting, to load data from external sources as
 * XML files, databases, etc. Different implementations of this interface know
 * different kind of sources.
 * 
 * <p><b>Life-cycle:</b> Data loaders are short-lived objects. They are created
 * when the data has to load, and then they are discarded immediately, not
 * reused. That is, the {@link #load} method is typically (but not by all means)
 * invoked only once. If a data loader needs to maintain state during a
 * processing session (such as cache data, pool connections, etc.) it should use
 * engine attributes for that purpose (see {@link Engine#setAttribute}).

     *     implements <code>freemarker.template.TemplateModel</code>, then it
     *     will not be wrapped, as it is already an FTL variable.
