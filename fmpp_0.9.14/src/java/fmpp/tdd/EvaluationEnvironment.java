     *        <li>{@link #EVENT_ENTER_SEQUENCE}, {@link #EVENT_ENTER_HASH}, and
     *            {@link #EVENT_ENTER_FUNCTION_PARAMS}: points the first

     *        <li>{@link #EVENT_LEAVE_SEQUENCE}, {@link #EVENT_LEAVE_HASH}, and

     *            or the character after the end of the string.
     *      </ul>  
     * @param name For {@link #EVENT_ENTER_HASH_KEY} and
     *     {@link #EVENT_ENTER_FUNCTION_PARAMS}, the name of the hash key or
     *     function. It is <code>null</code> otherwise.

     *           <code>Map</code> or <code>List</code>.

     *     return values for the events:

     *                pair. That is, the key:value pair will not be added to
     *                the map. The value expression will not be evaluated.
     *            <li>{@link #RETURN_FRAGMENT}: The value of the key:value pair
     *                will be the {@link Fragment} that stores the value
     *                expression. The value expression will not be evaluated.
     *                However, if the value is implicit boolean 
     *                <code>true</code>, (i.e. you omit the value) then
     *                {@link #RETURN_FRAGMENT} has no effect. 
     *          </ul>
     *       <li>
     *       <li>{@link #EVENT_ENTER_HASH} if the hash uses <tt>{</tt> and
