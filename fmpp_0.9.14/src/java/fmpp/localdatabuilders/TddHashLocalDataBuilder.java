/**
 * Builds data from a TDD hash, interpreting function calls as data loader
 * invocations. The hash is evaluated when {@link fmpp.LocalDataBuilder#build}
 * is invoked first. Then the result is stored until the end of the processing
 * session, to be reused for all subsequent {@link fmpp.LocalDataBuilder#build}
 * invokations.

 * last parameter to the <tt>case</tt> function is a hash, e.g.:<br>
 * <tt>localData: [case(sub/, {bgColor:green, doc:xml(data/foo.xml)})]</tt>.
