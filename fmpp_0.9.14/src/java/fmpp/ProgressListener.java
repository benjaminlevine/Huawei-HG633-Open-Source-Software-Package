/**
 * Interface to monitor the events of an <code>Engine</code>.
 * 
 * <p>The object that implements this interface need to be plugged into the
 * {@link Engine} to receive notifications about its events. For example, if you
 * add an object as engine attribute or as local data loader to the engine, it
 * will be notified about the events. Object that has no role other than
 * listening to events can to be plugged with
 * {@link Engine#addProgressListener}.
 * 
 * <p>Examples of the usage of progress listeners:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Displaying visually the progress of the processing session for the
 *       user.
 *   <li>Creating statistics about the processing session.
 *   <li>Implementing a poor man's logging (until no logging support added to
 *       FMPP)
 *   <li>Releasing the resources held by local data loaders and engine
 *       attributes when the session is finished.
 * </ul>

     *     As new event types can be introduced with new FMPP versions (even if
     *     it happens very seldom), a progress listener implementation should
     *     survive events that it does not understand. That is, it must not stop
     *     with an error, but it should silently ignore the event.
     * @param src Depending on <code>event</code> the source file or null.
     * @param pMode Depending on <code>event</code> the proccessing mode
     *     (<code>Engine.PMODE_...</code> constant) or
     *     <code>Engine.PMODE_NONE</code>. Note that new processing modes may
     *     be added as FMPP evolvers, so values that are not known be the
     *     progress listener should be handler nicely, and never cause error.  
     * @param error The error, or null if there was no error.
     * @param param Extra information about the event. The class and meaning of
     *     object depends on the concrete event:
     *     <ul>
     *       <li>For <code>EVENT_WARNING</code> it is a <code>String</code> that
     *           describles the reason of warning.
