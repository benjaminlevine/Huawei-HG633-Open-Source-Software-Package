This text describes how to (re)build FMPP and related files.


To (re)build lib/fmpp.jar (incremental building):

* Run "ant jar" from the FMPP root directory.


To (re)build the docs (incremental building):

* Run "ant docs" from the FMPP root directory.

NOTE: If you simply check out the SVN repositroy, you should add
FreeMarker documentation manually (or you get a warning). That is, copy
the pre-built FreeMarker documentation into the src/docs/freemarker
directory. Theoretically you should build the FreeMarker documentation
with the docgen module of FreeMarker SVN, but it is not trivial, so for
most users the best solution is to simply copy the docs/freemarker
directory of the latest FMPP distribution into src/docs/freemarker.


To (re)build the lib/fmpp.jar and the docs (incremental building):

* Run "ant" from the FMPP root directory.

NOTE: see the note above about docs building.


To really rebuild all (not incremental building):

* Run "ant all" from the FMPP root directory.


To build a distribution (dist/fmpp_<version>.tar.gz and zip):

* Set the correct version number in src/java/fmpp/version.propertyes.
  Releases use majorVersion.minorVersion.maintenanceVersion format, e.g.
  "0.8.15". Nightly releases has an additional ".5" at the end of the
  version number, such as "0.8.15.5", which is a nightly release *after*
  "0.8.15". Note that the version number can't contain letters because
  of the limitations of jar manifest format; this is why I use this
  strange convention to mark nightly releases.

* Make sure you use the classes of Java2 platfrom 1.2 for the
  compilation. Certainly you need to create build.properties for this;
  see build.properties.sample.

* Make sure of the proper version of freemarker.jar, oro.jar,
  bsh.jar, and resolver.jar is in the lib directory.

* Check if the dependency version ranges are up-to-date in the
  Maven POM (it's embedded into the build.xml), especially the
  FreeMarker version number.

* The test suite must be passed successfully. Run "ant test".

* Make sure of the proper version of FreeMarker documentation, which is
  Manual + API javadoc, is in the src/docs/freemarker directory.

* Make sure of you didn't polluted the FMPP directories with some
  temporary files (your ad-hoc tests, backups, etc.). If you left such
  files, they will be included in the distribution... Note that typical
  trash like *.bak, *.~*, SVN files, etc. should be filtered out
  automatically by Ant.

* Run "ant dist"

To build the WWW site (dist/site_<version>):

* First build the distribution. Don't run clean after that, because
  the size of the fmpp_x.x.x.tar.gz and zip must be known for the
  generation of the WWW pages.

* Run "ant site"

NOTE: The download link will use the download system of SourceForge. That
is, you do not upload the tar.gz and zip to the WWW site, but do an FMPP
release on SourceForge with the correct version number, or else the
download link will be broken.

Releases should be announced on the following places:
- Sourceforge.net email notification for subscribers
- FMPP mailing list (fmpp-open@lists.sourceforge.net)
- Freshmeat.net
